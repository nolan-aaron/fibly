# Fibly 🌀

This application takes a continuous stream of user-supplied numbers as input. If any of these numbers happens to be a Fibonacci number, it will output **FIB**. Additionally, at a regular interval set by the user, it will output the provided numbers in descending order of their frequency.

## Written Response

1. You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a web app, a different UI may be a REPL). Please describe how you would go about implementing this new UI in your application? Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?

1. You now need to make your application “production ready”, and deploy it so that it can be used by customers. Please describe the steps you’d need to take for this to happen.

## Written Response

1. You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a web app, a different UI may be a REPL). Please describe how you would go about implementing this new UI in your application? Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?
